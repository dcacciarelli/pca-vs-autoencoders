# On the connection between PCA and autoencoders
This repo contains the code for replicating the results from the paper on PCA and autoencoders published in Quality Engineering.

This repo contains:
1. `autoencoder.py`: methods to obtain the encoded features from a linear autoencoder.
2. `sampling_strategies.py`: simple implementation of PCA.
3. `comparison.ipynb`: notebook showing how the use the previous strategies and plot the results.
