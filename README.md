Here's an improved README file for your PCA vs Autoencoders repository with better structure, images, and explanations.

### **PCA vs Autoencoders: Understanding Hidden Data Structures**
This repository contains the code and materials for the paper *"Hidden Dimensions of the Data: PCA vs Autoencoders"* published in *Quality Engineering*. It explores the connections between Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear autoencoders, providing insights into dimensionality reduction and latent feature extraction.

## **Overview**
Both PCA and autoencoders aim to find a lower-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data, but they achieve this through different mechanisms. This repository provides:
- A simple PCA implementation and its comparison with autoencoders.
- A regularized autoencoder to explore feature extraction under constraints.
- A set of scripts and a Jupyter notebook to generate and visualize results.

## **Repository Structure**
### **Codebase**
- `pca.py` - Implements PCA-based encoding.
- `autoencoder.py` - Defines a simple linear autoencoder.
- `autoencoder_regularized.py` - Implements a regularized version of the autoencoder.
- `comparison.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook to compare PCA and autoencoder results.
- `comparison_simulations.py` - Runs simulations to visualize PCA and autoencoder encodings.
- `comparison_regularized.py` - Evaluates the impact of regularization on autoencoders.

### **Example Comparison**
Below is an example visualization comparing PCA with autoencoder encodings:

## **How to Use**
### **Requirements**
Ensure you have Python installed with the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm
```

### **Running Experiments**
You can test the PCA and autoencoder encoding methods by running:
```bash
python comparison_simulations.py
```
or interactively exploring:
```bash
jupyter notebook comparison.ipynb
```

## **Results & Key Findings**
- PCA and linear autoencoders can yield similar feature transformations, but the training mechanisms differ.
- Regularization in autoencoders introduces additional constraints that impact feature extraction.
- The study provides insights into when each method is preferable for dimensionality reduction tasks.
